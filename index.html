                Having a physical image evokes more of an emotional response than a digital image and a live image captures the full extent of the subject being photographed. However, there are currently no cameras that can capture a live image and instantly print it from the same device.
Lenticular printing is a process that combines multiple images into one and gives a live or moving effect to the image when applied with a lenticular lens. This process is very costly and time consuming so it is not something that is accessible to those who do not have the right resources.

        <p>
            Our next step was to build a cardboard prototype of the camera. The design includes a base where images are printed out of and film gets loaded, a viewfinder, a shutter button, and a slot for cassette tapes attached to the image to be swiped through. This was with the eventual goal in mind of allowing sound to be included with the printed image. We continued with the design choice of one lens taking multiple images to keep the product having a similar aesthetic to other cameras. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We returned to cardboard a few more times during our prototyping process. First after we decided that we wanted to house or interior in box compartments that lock together, and second after we experimented changing the distance between the two cameras to find the optimal length between them.

        </div>
        <p>
            After our cardboard prototype we decided to move on to our next phase of 3d printed prototypes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our first version was based on precedent work and featured two cameras in order to capture two images to be turned into one lenticular image. This two camera design allowed for images to be taken simultaneously and capture movement optimally.  We quickly realized that adjustments needed to be made due to changes in the type of camera that we were using and how much space the inner components took up. This prototype also focused more on the outer casing of the camera. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our second version featured camera frames in which the camera was supposed to slip into. Then we found out that these frames did not work to hold the camera, furthermore we decided to focus on housing the inner components together before creating the outer body. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Before making version three we decided to do a cardboard prototype to understand how to create boxes that our internal components (e.g. printer, battery) could fit into and be connected to each other. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            So now onto version three, in this version we focused on creating housing for the printer and the battery and having them be attached to each other. We ran into problems due to using the makerbot printer because the print warped during printing and was wildly inaccurate to the CAD; we from here on then decided to use the prusa 3d printers due to their superior print quality. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            Our fourth version was much improved in print quality. This version also featured holes in the top of the printer case in order to attach standoffs that would also be attached to the screen of the camera. We decided to next focus on attaching the cameras to the interior components. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            Our fifth version was reflective, featuring a camera holder in which the cameras could be screwed into. This camera holder was attached by pillars to the bottom of the printer. We then realized that this solution was inadequate as the pillars made it hard to screw in the camera and difficult for wire management. 
        </p>
        <p>  
            Our final version was almost the same as our fifth version except we changed the camera holder to be separate from the printer body. This camera holder had screw holds from which one could attach standoffs that could be then screwed into the printer body’s holes. Ultimately we decided that this version was the optimal solution to hold our inner components together.

            <p>
                A major challenge was actually printing the images and producing them as lenticular images. Lenticular images appear best when using a high resolution inkjet printer, but these printers are very large and there is no way to make them mobile. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We use an HP Sprocket 200 printer which uses Zero Ink (Zink) technology to print images. This allows for our printer to be portable and attached to the camera, but with lower resolution images. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another challenge regarding images was finding the right lenticular sheets to apply to the images. Our initial prototypes used sheets with 60 lenticules per inch (LPI), and while these showed some lenticular effect, it was still unclear and not very consistent. Producing a lenticular print requires precision and finding the right value of LPI for a sheet is very difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                After lots of experimentation, we found that lenticular sheets of 40 LPI produced the best results with our printed images.

                    Lenticular cameras have been around since the 80’s. The Nimslo Corporation was one of the first companies to produce a lenticular camera. In 1982, Nimslo introduced the Nimslo 3D which used four camera lenses to take four images at once. The images taken with the camera were intended to be separately produced as lenticular prints, which at the time could also only be done by Nimslo. However, due to the process taking up to months, the idea never really caught much traction.

                    In 1989, the Nishika Corporation acquired part of Nimslo, and their patents along with it. They began producing the Nishika N8000 which was a continuation of the Nimslo 3D. It offered a more sleek design while maintaining the functionality of the Nimslo 3D. 

                    However, with the printing technology still not being caught up to the cameras, both Nishika and Nimslo went out of business.

Polaroid cameras have become extremely popular and are still widely used to instantly print images. They do not however support multiple images at once to produce a lenticular print.

            Next Steps
        </h2> 

        <p>
            While we have a product that is functional, we are still looking at ways to improve it. For example, we would like to make the shutter button an actual push button instead of a touch screen button on our interface. Additionally, we would like to house the current prototype into another casing with the appearance of a camera. This will help with cable management and provide more affordances of a normal camera.
